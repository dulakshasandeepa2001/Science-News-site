        title: "The Exoplanet Revolution",
        content: "Just three decades ago, we knew of only one planetary system: our own Solar System. Today, we've confirmed over 5,000 exoplanets orbiting distant stars, with thousands more candidates awaiting confirmation. This explosive growth in discoveries has transformed our understanding of planetary systems and dramatically increased the chances of finding life elsewhere in the universe."

        title: "Detection Methods",
        content: "Finding planets around distant stars is incredibly challenging - they're tiny, dim objects next to blindingly bright stars. Astronomers have developed several clever techniques. The transit method detects the slight dimming of a star as a planet passes in front of it. The radial velocity method measures the wobble in a star's motion caused by an orbiting planet's gravity. Direct imaging, though difficult, has captured actual pictures of some massive planets far from their stars."

        title: "The Habitable Zone",
        content: "Not all exoplanets are created equal when it comes to hosting life. Scientists focus on planets in the 'habitable zone' - the region around a star where conditions might allow liquid water to exist on a planet's surface. This zone depends on the star's temperature and brightness. For our Sun, Earth sits comfortably in the habitable zone, while Venus is too hot and Mars too cold."

      {
        title: "Earth-Like Worlds",
        content: "Several discovered exoplanets show tantalizing similarities to Earth. Proxima Centauri b, orbiting our nearest stellar neighbor just 4.2 light-years away, might have the right temperature for liquid water. TRAPPIST-1 system hosts seven Earth-sized planets, three of which are in the habitable zone. Kepler-452b, often called 'Earth's cousin,' orbits a Sun-like star in the habitable zone and is only about 60% larger than Earth."

      {
        title: "Biosignatures: Signs of Life",
        content: "Finding an exoplanet isn't enough - we need to determine if it hosts life. Scientists look for 'biosignatures' - molecules in a planet's atmosphere that could indicate biological activity. On Earth, oxygen produced by photosynthesis makes up 21% of our atmosphere. Finding significant oxygen, along with other gases like methane, in an exoplanet's atmosphere would be strong evidence for life."

        title: "The James Webb Space Telescope",
        content: "Launched in 2021, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is revolutionizing exoplanet science. Its infrared vision can analyze the atmospheres of distant planets in unprecedented detail. JWST has already detected carbon dioxide, water vapor, and other molecules in exoplanet atmospheres. Each observation brings us closer to potentially detecting biosignatures."

        title: "Technosignatures: Looking for Intelligence",
        content: "Beyond simple microbial life, some astronomers search for signs of technological civilizations. SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) projects scan for radio signals, laser pulses, or other evidence of artificial origin. While we haven't detected any technosignatures yet, the search continues with ever-improving technology and methods."

      {
        title: "The Drake Equation and Fermi Paradox",
        content: "The Drake Equation, formulated in 1961, estimates the number of detectable civilizations in our galaxy. With billions of potentially habitable planets, the equation suggests we shouldn't be alone. This leads to the Fermi Paradox: if life is common, where is everybody? Perhaps we're among the first, life is rarer than we think, civilizations don't last long, or they simply haven't found us yet."

      {
        title: "Future Missions and Hope",
        content: "The next generation of telescopes and space missions promises even more exciting discoveries. The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, planned for the late 2020s, will discover thousands of new exoplanets. Ground-based extremely large telescopes will directly image Earth-like planets. Within our lifetimes, we may finally answer humanity's oldest question: Are we alone in the universe?"
