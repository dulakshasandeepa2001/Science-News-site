  summary: "The latest images of Comet Lemmon (C/2025 A6) show that a portion of its tail has been 'torn off' by solar wind as it approaches the Sun after passing its closest point to Earth.",

        title: "Tail Disruption Event",
        content: "The latest images of Comet Lemmon (C/2025 A6), which is now approaching the Sun after passing its closest point to Earth, show that a portion of its tail has been 'torn off'. Scientists indicate that the cause is the solar wind blowing from the Sun."

      {
        title: "Timing of the Event",
        content: "The tail disruption occurred a few days before last Tuesday (October 21), when the comet was scheduled to make its closest approach to Earth. This timing provided astronomers with an excellent opportunity to observe and document the phenomenon."
      },
      {
        title: "First Photographic Evidence",
        content: "Astrophotographer Petr Horálek first captured this phenomenon in a photograph taken at dawn on October 18 near Lake Seč in the Czech Republic. The original wide-field image also captured colorful red-pink auroras (Northern Lights) visible low in the night sky."
      },
      {
        title: "Geomagnetic Storm Connection",
        content: "These Northern Lights were the result of a G2 (moderate) class geomagnetic storm that began that same morning. This temporary disturbance to Earth's magnetic field was caused by a coronal mass ejection (CME) from the Sun colliding with our planet's atmosphere, occurring about two days later than initially expected."
      },
      {
        title: "Solar Wind vs. Coronal Mass Ejection",
        content: "However, scientists note that the solar coronal mass ejection was not responsible for the tearing of Comet Lemmon's tail, but rather it was caused by a strong solar wind gust. This distinction is important for understanding the different solar phenomena affecting cometary behavior."
      },
      {
        title: "Rare Disconnection Events",
        content: "Rhythmic ripples forming along the length of the tail as it approaches the Sun are not unusual. However, complete separation of portions of the flowing tail, known as disconnection events, are much rarer and provide valuable insights into comet-solar wind interactions."
      },
      {
        title: "Previous Disruptions",
        content: "This was not the first time Comet Lemmon's tail was struck by solar wind. According to Space.com, the tail was also buffeted by a strong solar wind gust in late September, and a minor disconnection event was reported on October 4. In each instance, the comet's tail returned to its normal state within a few hours after fragmentation."
      },
      {
        title: "Scientific Significance",
        content: "These observations provide astronomers with valuable data about how solar wind interacts with cometary material, helping to better understand both solar activity and cometary composition. The rapid recovery of the tail also demonstrates the dynamic nature of these celestial objects."
