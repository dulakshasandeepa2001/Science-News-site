  summary: "A new study has revealed that the comet 3I/ATLAS, which arrived from outside our solar system, is leaking water like \"a fire hose running at full blast.\"",

        title: "Unprecedented Water Detection",
        content: "Using NASA's Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, scientists have for the first time identified the chemical fingerprint of water leaking from 3I/ATLAS, the third object from another star system observed traveling through our solar system."

        title: "Cosmic Measuring Stick",
        content: "Water serves as a kind of cosmic measuring stick in comet studies, and carefully tracking it is important for measuring how sunlight drives a comet's activity and how it releases other gases. Identifying it in an interstellar visitor allows astronomers to directly compare 3I/ATLAS with comets native to our solar system."
      },
      {
        title: "Direct Chemical Comparison",
        content: "This discovery provides a rare opportunity to study the chemistry of distant planetary systems. By analyzing the water signature from an interstellar comet, researchers can gain insights into the formation processes occurring around other stars."
      },
      {
        title: "Observatory Findings",
        content: "Denis Bodewits, a physics professor at Auburn University, and his team observed 3I/ATLAS in July and August 2025 using the Swift telescope, when it was located approximately 2.9 times the distance between Earth and the Sun. This distance is typically much farther than the zone where cometary water ice vaporizes."
      },
      {
        title: "Ultraviolet Detection",
        content: "The study reports that even at this distance, the Swift telescope detected the ultraviolet glow of hydroxyl (OH), a condition resulting from water molecules being broken down by sunlight. This detection method provides crucial evidence of active water outgassing."
      },
      {
        title: "Fire Hose Comparison",
        content: "As detailed in a paper published on September 30 in the Astrophysical Journal Letters, the results showed that 3I/ATLAS is ejecting water at a rate of approximately 40 kilograms per second. This is why it can be compared to a fire hose operating at full force."
      },
      {
        title: "Exceptional Activity Level",
        content: "Based on this outflow rate, the team estimates that at least 8% of the comet's surface must be active. The study notes that this is a surprisingly large value compared to the 3% to 5% typically seen in comets in our solar system, suggesting unique characteristics of this interstellar visitor."
