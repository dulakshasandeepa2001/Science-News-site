        title: "Unusual Discovery",
        content: "A rare shark with an abnormal body color condition was encountered during a fishing competition held in Costa Rica. This condition, called Xanthism, which gives the body a yellow to orange color, was found in a 6.5-foot-long Nurse Shark (Ginglymostoma cirratum)."
      },
      {
        title: "First Documented Case",
        content: "Although the Xanthism condition has been previously observed in several fish species, it had not been reported in cartilaginous fish such as sharks and rays. This makes this rare encounter particularly special."
      },
      {
        title: "Dual Condition",
        content: "In addition to the Xanthism condition, this shark was also observed to suffer from albinism, as evidenced by its eyes appearing bright white. This combination of conditions makes the specimen even more remarkable."
      },
      {
        title: "Normal Coloration",
        content: "Normally, Nurse sharks have a dark coloration that blends with coral reefs and the ocean floor. This camouflage helps them hunt and avoid predators in their natural habitat."
      },
      {
        title: "Research Implications",
        content: "A research report published by Rio Grande University on this matter shows that attention should be focused on whether this is a rare one-time occurrence or a genetic tendency in the shark population residing in the relevant marine area."
      },
      {
        title: "Survival Despite Differences",
        content: "The study also shows that considering the shark's physical nature and grown size, this color variation does not appear to have adversely affected its life. This suggests that despite its distinctive coloration, the shark has been able to successfully hunt, avoid predators, and reach adulthood."
