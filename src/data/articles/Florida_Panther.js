        title: "Revival of a Species",
        content: "The Florida panther, once teetering on the edge of extinction with fewer than 30 individuals remaining in the wild, has made a remarkable comeback. Conservation efforts spanning decades have helped the population grow to an estimated 120-230 adults and subadults, representing one of America's most significant endangered species recovery stories."

      {
        title: "Genetic Intervention",
        content: "A pivotal moment in the species' recovery came in 1995 when scientists introduced eight female Texas pumas to address severe inbreeding issues. This genetic rescue mission has proven successful, with the panthers showing fewer birth defects and improved survival rates in subsequent generations."

      {
        title: "Habitat Challenges",
        content: "Despite population growth, Florida panthers face ongoing habitat fragmentation as development continues across their range. Each adult requires up to 200 square miles of territory, making habitat preservation critical to their continued recovery."
      },
      {
        title: "Vehicle Collisions",
        content: "Vehicle strikes remain the leading cause of known panther deaths, with an average of 25 panthers killed on Florida roads annually. Wildlife crossings and fencing along major highways have helped reduce these fatalities in key corridors."
      },
      {
        title: "Coexistence with Humans",
        content: "As the panther population grows, interactions with human settlements have increased. Conservation organizations are working with local communities to develop coexistence strategies, including secure livestock enclosures and educational programs."
      },
      {
        title: "Conservation Success Factors",
        content: "The recovery has been attributed to strict protection under the Endangered Species Act, habitat conservation through land acquisition programs, wildlife crossings, and public education campaigns that have garnered support for panther conservation."

      {
        title: "Future Prospects",
        content: "Scientists believe establishing additional breeding populations outside South Florida will be crucial for long-term recovery. Potential reintroduction sites are being evaluated in northern Florida and adjacent states with suitable habitat."
