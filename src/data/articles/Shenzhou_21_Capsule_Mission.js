        title: "Astronauts Stranded at Tiangong",
        content: "Three more Chinese astronauts are currently 'stranded' at China's Tiangong space station. Experts point out that this latest situation highlights deficiencies in China's space operations procedures. The situation has raised concerns about contingency planning in China's space program."

        title: "The Shenzhou-21 Crew",
        content: "The three astronauts currently stuck at Tiangong without the ability to return to Earth are Shang Lu, Wu Fei, and Shang Hongshang. The Shenzhou-21 mission carrying these three docked with Tiangong on October 31st. Their purpose was to take over space station operations from the previous crew."
      },
      {
        title: "Crew Rotation Plans",
        content: "Their purpose was to take over space station operations from the Shenzhou-20 mission astronauts Wang Jie, Cheng Shongrui, and Chen Dong, who were scheduled to depart on November 5th, and relieve them of their service duty. However, these plans were disrupted by an unexpected problem."
      },

        title: "Space Debris Impact",
        content: "However, the Shenzhou-20 astronauts had to wait longer to return to Earth after damage was observed on the capsule they were to board, caused by a piece of space debris impact. This incident demonstrates the ongoing hazard that orbital debris poses to space operations."

        title: "Extended Stay and Emergency Solution",
        content: "Ultimately, they had to remain at the Tiangong station for several additional days, and on November 14th, steps were taken to safely bring them back to Earth through the capsule assigned to the Shenzhou-21 mission. This decision solved one problem but created another."
      },
      {
        title: "Current Situation",
        content: "But now the Shenzhou-21 mission astronauts do not have a capsule attached to Tiangong to return in. However, unofficial sources have indicated that the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) is making arrangements to send an unmanned capsule to Tiangong for them."
      },
      {
        title: "Planned Rescue Mission",
        content: "This is reported to occur around November 24th. The unmanned capsule will provide the stranded astronauts with a means to return to Earth safely. The CMSA is working to expedite the launch preparations."
      },
      {
        title: "Safety Concerns",
        content: "However, experts point out that if the Shenzhou-21 crew faces a dangerous situation before then (such as another space junk impact), there is a risk that they may not be able to return safely to Earth. This vulnerability period has raised concerns among space safety experts."

      {
        title: "Expert Commentary",
        content: "\"I'm very happy that the Shenzhou-20 crew made it home. But the replacement crew not having a vehicle to get back to Earth is somewhat concerning,\" Victoria Samson, Chief Director of Space Security and Stability at the nonprofit organization Secure World Foundation based in Colorado, told Scientific American."

      {
        title: "Damaged Capsule Disposal",
        content: "It is also reported that after the return capsule arrives at Tiangong, the damaged Shenzhou-20 capsule will be detached from the docking station and deorbited over the Pacific Ocean. This will clear the docking port for future missions."
      },
      {
        title: "Mission Continuation",
        content: "It is expected that the Shenzhou-21 crew will complete their six-month mission as originally planned. Despite the setback, the astronauts remain in good health and continue their scientific work aboard the station while awaiting their return capsule."
      },
      {
        title: "Implications for Space Operations",
        content: "This incident highlights the need for robust contingency planning in human spaceflight operations. The lack of a backup return vehicle has exposed a potential vulnerability in China's space station program, suggesting that future missions may need to include additional safety redundancies to protect astronaut crews."
