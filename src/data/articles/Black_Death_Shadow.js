        title: "The Black Death's Historical Toll",
        content: "The Yersinia pestis bacterium, measuring just three micrometers in size, claimed 200 million human lives in medieval times. This bacterium created the 'Black Death' pandemic that spread across Europe between 1346-1353, known as the most horrific and severe pandemic experienced in the brief history of mankind."

        content: "Y. pestis, which primarily spreads through infected rodents and fleas, disappeared into the sands of time with humanity's discovery of the previously unseen world of microorganisms through science, along with better urban planning and improved sanitary practices. However, it has never been completely eradicated, occasionally allowing isolated infected incidents to occur like echoes from humanity's darkest chapters."

        title: "Modern-Day Cases and California's Recent Incident",
        content: "Last week, a person infected with Y. pestis was confirmed in El Dorado County, Sacramento, California. The county's supervising public health director issued a media statement noting that this bacterium naturally exists in many places in California. Therefore, the announcement further stated that individuals and pet owners going hiking, mountain climbing, and camping - especially to areas where wild rodents frequently inhabit - should pay attention to this matter and take preventive measures."

        content: "The person confirmed to be infected with the disease is currently receiving medical treatment at home and is reported to be recovering. While reports of the Black Death pandemic from America have been rare in recent times, it has been significantly reported in several regions of Africa. The bacterium is suspected to have arrived in California in the 1900s."
