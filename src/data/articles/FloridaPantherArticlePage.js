        title: "Background",
        content: "The Florida Panther (Puma concolor coryi) is a subspecies of mountain lion, also known as cougar or puma. Due to hunting and habitat loss, they are now restricted to less than 5% of their original territory in Florida."

        title: "Population Crisis and Genetic Rescue",
        content: "By the 1990s, fewer than 30 Florida Panthers remained, and inbreeding within the small population became a threat to their survival. In 1995, scientists brought eight female panthers from Texas to Florida to increase genetic diversity. Thirty years later, inbreeding has decreased and the population has risen to around 200."

        title: "Preserving Subspecies Identity",
        content: "A recent study revealed that despite the introduction of new genes, the genetic characteristics that make Florida Panthers their own subspecies have not been lost. This research was published in PNAS on July 28th."

        title: "Results of Genetic Mixing",
        content: "Of the eight Texas cats introduced, five successfully bred. Over time, symptoms of inbreeding such as kinked tails and reproductive problems have decreased. Researchers mapped the genomes of current Florida Panther generations and found that Texas puma genes had not overwhelmed the genetic lineage unique to Florida. Instead, they helped reduce harmful mutations."

        title: "Conservation Implications",
        content: "\"One major problem with bringing individual cats from Texas was the possibility of completely replacing the genetic diversity unique to Florida,\" says study co-author Diana Aguilar-Gomez. The study shows Florida's genes are still largely preserved, and the population is healthier."
