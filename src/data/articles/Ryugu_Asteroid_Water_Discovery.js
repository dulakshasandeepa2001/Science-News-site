  title: "Ryugu Asteroid Reveals It Once Contained Liquid Water",
  summary: "With indications that large volumes of water once flowed inside the asteroid Ryugu, it appears that asteroids may have brought much more water to Earth than previously thought.",

        title: "Water Origins Mystery",
        content: "The origin of water on Earth is somewhat mysterious, but asteroids have been proposed as one of its sources. However, there are doubts about whether enough asteroid impacts occurred to bring all the water present on Earth today. New findings from the Ryugu asteroid suggest asteroids may have carried much more water than previously estimated."

        title: "Hayabusa 2 Mission",
        content: "Carbonaceous asteroids like Ryugu are formed from dust and ice from outside the solar system. In 2019, Japan's Hayabusa 2 spacecraft landed on Ryugu, collected 5.4 grams of material, and brought it back to Earth in 2020. This mission provided scientists with pristine samples to study."

        title: "Unexpected Discoveries",
        content: "Initial photographs of Ryugu showed it to be drier than expected. However, recent studies revealed that the object is filled with cracks that could be suspected of containing components essential for life, including water. This discovery changed scientists' understanding of the asteroid's composition."
      },
      {
        title: "Ancient Origins",
        content: "Initial dating of the samples suggested that this asteroid is one of the oldest objects in the solar system. That is, it could be as old as 4.6 billion years, dating back to when the solar system was formed. This made Ryugu an invaluable time capsule from the early solar system."
      },
      {
        title: "Dating Anomaly",
        content: "However, when Tsuyoshi Iizuka of Tokyo University and his colleagues calculated its age based on the radioactive decay of lutetium-176 to hafnium-176 at very small sample levels in the asteroid, they obtained an unbelievably ancient origin time, which was surprising."
      },
      {
        title: "Impossible Age",
        content: "\"When we studied the samples obtained from Ryugu, we got an age close to 4.8 billion years. That's much older than the age of the solar system. This means the 'time markers' in the Ryugu samples are incorrect,\" says Iizuka. This impossibility led researchers to investigate what could have altered the dating markers."
      },
      {
        title: "Liquid Water Evidence",
        content: "The research team believes that about a billion years after Ryugu's parent body formed, something caused the asteroid to heat up enough for ice to turn into liquid water. This would have removed some of the lutetium-176, contaminating the dating methodology and providing evidence of past liquid water activity."
      },
      {
        title: "Heating Mechanism",
        content: "Solar radiation can heat surface ice to a maximum depth of only about 40 centimeters, while Ryugu samples were obtained from depths of up to a meter. Researchers say the most likely explanation for the heating of the parent asteroid's interior is a collision with another object, which would have generated enough heat to melt the internal ice."
      },
      {
        title: "High Water Content",
        content: "By calculating the volume of water needed to alter the amount of lutetium-176 in Ryugu samples, the research team notes that the asteroid contained between 20% and 30% water. This is a much higher value than previously published estimates and suggests asteroids could have delivered far more water to early Earth than scientists previously believed."
      },
      {
        title: "Implications for Earth",
        content: "This discovery has profound implications for understanding how Earth acquired its oceans. If asteroids like Ryugu contained such high water content, the number of asteroid impacts needed to deliver Earth's water would be significantly lower than previously calculated, making the asteroid-delivery hypothesis much more plausible."
