        title: "Species Identification",
        content: "This dinosaur is approximately 7 meters long and belongs to a previously unidentified dinosaur species called Megaraptoran. They are believed to have roamed land masses that are now South America, Australia, and Asia."

        title: "Physical Characteristics",
        content: "Megaraptorans are distinguished by their long skulls and jaws with strong and large claws, according to Lucio Ibiricu of the Patagonian Institute of Geology and Paleontology, a member of the research team."

        title: "Research Challenges",
        content: "However, how these animals hunted and their exact positions in the evolutionary timeline have not been definitively determined. The reason for this is that the fossils discovered so far have been in an incomplete state."

        title: "Fossil Site Discovery",
        content: "In a new study, researchers stated that they found parts of the skull, as well as bones from the arms, legs, and tail in the Lago Colhu√© Huapi rock formation in Patagonia. They observed unique characteristics in these bones and realized this could be a new species."

        title: "Age and Mortality",
        content: "This animal is believed to have lived between 66 and 70 million years ago. It was at least 19 years old when it died, but the cause of death could not be determined."

        title: "Dietary Evidence",
        content: "The foot trapped in the dinosaur's jaw belongs to a species of prehistoric archosaurs that are related to modern crocodiles. It has been identified as a front foot bone. This food provides insight into the dietary patterns of megaraptorans, and it appears that they may have been the most powerful predators widespread in those areas at that time."
