        title: "Unprecedented Mass",
        content: "The black hole's mass of 36 billion solar masses makes it one of the most massive ever discovered. This finding challenges our understanding of how such massive black holes could have formed in the early universe."
      },
      {
        title: "Observational Techniques",
        content: "The discovery was made using advanced gravitational lensing techniques, which allow astronomers to study objects that would otherwise be too distant or faint to observe directly."
